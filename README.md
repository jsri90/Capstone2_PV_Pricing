# Solar Energy - a good long term bet?

Photovoltaic installations are a increasing in number and with a growing concern about global warming, the technology needs to be adopted more. In order for an increased adoption, this has to be a financialy viable option for the end consumer. In order to achive that target, there needs to be improvement in the Photo Voltaic (PV) technology. Additionally, PV installers need to be able to provide a cost effective solution that offers a benefit to the end user in the long run. In order for PV installers to develop such a solution, they need to understand the impact of the different factors affecting the price of a PV installation system.

The aim of this project is to provide a data driven analsysis of the various cost factors that they can then use to estimate the costs of a PV system.

Model Metrics file

Data Set features: 

Year - The year of installation
System Size in kW - DC system size of the installation in kW
New Construction - Dummy Variable indicating if the system installation is a new construction or an upgrade of an existing installation
Ground Mounted - Dummy Variable indicating if the system is installed on the ground or the rooftop
State - Location of the installation in the United State. States covered are CA, MA, NH, FL
Installer Name - Name of the Solar system installer
DC  Optimizer - A device that helps improve efficiency of the system. This feature is a dummy variable indicating if the system has a DC Optimizer or not.
Dollar per watt - The dependent variable that is of interest in this problem. Calculated values are in $ / kiloWatt
Overall Module Efficiency - Numerical value of the overall efficiency of the PV modules being installed
Micro Inverter - Dummy variable indicating if the installation includes a micro-inverter technology
Installer experience - Uses the date of installation and Installer name to calculate the total number of systems installed to that date.
Premium Module - Dummy Variable indicating if the the system uses a Premium Module i.e a module with efficiency >20%.
